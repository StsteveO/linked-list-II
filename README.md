## The Odin Project: Linked Lists (Round 2)
[**Click here**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists "The Odin Project") for project instructions.

One of the things that really helped me understand linked lists, is by making the actual data relative to somthing I am interested in. This makes it more appealing becuase instead of working on "data", and "nodes", I'll be working with information I am familiar with, which will help me understand why linked lists (and data structures in general) are important. 

For this project, instead of using *face-less* "data", and "nodes", I will actually use terminology to help me order the Star Wars movies.
